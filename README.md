# Medicamina constitution

<div style="text-align: justify">This document shall be considered the constitution and the declaration of the corporate organisation medicamina. The terms of this constitution will apply to the operational modus operandi of medicamina. </div>

## Organsational mission

<div style="text-align: justify">The goal of medicamina is to develop open source technological tools for the field of medicine, pharmacology and bioinformatics. All information which does not compromise the privacy of our customers shall henceforth open source, including but not limited to application source code, database structures, machine learning algorithms, company profits and expenditures, and any tools created for daily use. Open soruce does not imply freedom to infringe on medicaminas intellectual property but the freedom to learn from developed technologies to further and progress the field of medicine. </div>

## Genesis chronicle

<div style="text-align: justify">During a human genetics and precision medicine class a lecture was given in which it was stated approximately 50% of SSRI's are ineffective in the treatment of depression in patients due to pharmacogenetic factors. The misdiagnosis of therapuetic medications can be avoided with correct prior screening of patients using newly developed technologies. Current technologies allow for the genetic screening of individuals but the technology is rarely used in a common clincal setting, after learning about the possibilty to prevent misdiagnosis using genetic data a decision was made to create medicamina, an application which will allow indivduals to carry around their vital genetic, previous diagnostic, and family history information. Medicamina's goal was to move the center of information from the physicians cabinet to the patients pocket and for the patinet to be able to grant a doctor access to information while also being able to intrepret the data themselves. A model was designed in which the individual will get a genetic test and have the results sent to their devices, then this information can be used at every consultation to prevent misdiagnosis at any clinic. </div>

### Initial feature set

1. Genetic data importation
2. Automatic disease and genetic polymorphism detection
3. The ability to import parent and child data to analyse familial origin of genetic disease
4. Avoidance of potential familial genetic disease with preventative treatment
5. Drug-Gene interaction analysis

### Managment roles
#### Shareholders

<div style="text-align: justify">Share holders will have no vote on comapny direction. There is nothing meaningful a shareholder can say on the direction of the product unless they are a highly educated and skilled craftsman in science and biomedical engineering. The average shareholder will have nothing meaningful to say other than maximise profits. If someone has the skills to make a positive impact on medicaminas success they can join the company as an employee or submit their idea in an open source spirit instead of trying to parachute in. </div>

#### Board of advisors

<div style="text-align: justify">A team of 8, appointed and removed by majority rule decision in meeting by Directors + CEO (3/4 vote or 75%).

Board of advisors can overrule CEO's decision by majority rule vote (6/8 votes or 75%).

Preferably people with double degrees in business + engineering or business + science.

Acts as a de facto senate, adivising the corporate leaders and executives while the CEO acts autonomously, if a CEO makes a wrong decision the board of advisors can veto the decision. Board of advisors can not direct medicamina or employees excluding by veto power of CEO. Organisational decision making is the role of the CEO and directors. The advisors job is to analyse future markets, technologies and research to maintain organisational vigour and innovative energy then to educate executives and produce internal reports. Taking the role of both treasurer and market analyst, leaving risk making decisions to the CEO.

Department directors should be invited to CEO-Board of Advisor meetings and information allowed to propogate organsationally wide but meetings should be viewed as guidance from experts and not rule by leadership. Director attendence is not mandatory but since advisor appointment and removal depends on director participation attendence it is permitted. </div>

#### Directors

<div style="text-align: justify">Directors are appointed and removed by meeting with majority vote by current directors and CEO (3/4 votes or 75%). A directors position can be discharged at any moment for misconduct or under performance by majority vote of current directors and CEO (3/4 votes or 75%). Directors will be given a budget from the CEO for their entire department and have to operate within the constraints govenered by the business. </div>

#### CEO

<div style="text-align: justify">CEO position is appointed by anonymous vote from all current directors, board advisors and project managers in majority rule appointment (>50% of vote). CEO position is removed by anonymous vote from all current directors, board advisors and project managers in majorty rule appointmet (>75% of vote). The CEO has the final say when it comes to budgetting, risk taking and general business guiding so long as it does not breach the constituion of medicamina or get vetoed by the board of advisors. A CEO does not have to be an expert at all fields of expertise within medicamina, they only need to have the business leadership to negotiate with the right people and set budgets and future economic market predictions. Industry specific decision making will be govenered by the director of the respective field. </div>

### Middle managment
#### Project managers

<div style="text-align: justify">Middle management are appointed by directors. Project managers have the ability to hire/fire staff on their team, the team can have a maximum of 10 members. A project manager is assigned a project by a director or can be appointed as head of a newly formed team by providing an innovation solution to a problem. Project managers report to the director who has the authority to dissolve a team. A project manager may lead a laboratory, a github repository or a design team. A budget will be assigned to the project manager by the director and this will constrain their staff expenditures. </div>

### Role responsibilities
#### Deparment roles

<div style="text-align: justify">

- Engineering is to develope, design, implement and create technical soltuions to complex digitial problems.
 
- Medical Research is to collect, correlate, analyse and infer decisions from genetic data and publish results where new pharmacogenetic or bioinformatic discoveries are found. 

- Sales communicates and solves problems with physicians and customers wishing to upgrade their service.

- Design creates user experience processes and user interfaces for the engineering team and marketing departments.

- Marketing creates solutions to reach broader audiences with the goal of having every person on the world on medicamina and drastically reducing world wide the drug misdiagnoses. 

- Customer support solves problems for customers and creates documentation for how to use guides. 

- Communications purpose is to charismatically mingle with project managers, directors and advisors to communicate information effectively and to extract information on products to make sure everyone knows what features are out, what changes have been made and of what plans are coming - to minimise team isolation and essentially being a meeting creator between project managers.
